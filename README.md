# 6502

Integrated macro assembler, simulator and debugger for 650x microprocessor family. Allows you to write, test, and run 6502/65c02 programs.

~~Can be built with free Community Edition Visual Studio 2017.~~

This branch is currently being ported to wxWidgets and CMake so it can be built on multiple platforms.

~~NOTE: THAT THIS BRANCH IS NOT CURRENTLY IN A BUILDABLE STATE!~~

Build works now, but do not expect the code to work:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../kowalski/CMakeFiles.txt
make
